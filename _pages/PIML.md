# [IPMAS 2023](https://eventos.cmm.uchile.cl/ipmas2023/)

## Short Course: Introduction to physics-informed machine learning

January 10-12, 2023

In this course we will cover the basics of machine learning and physical modeling. In particular, we will learn about the terminology in these areas and their connections, and how to combine machine learning with physical models to get the better of both worlds. The course will culminate with practical applications of these tools in a workshop.
