I am an assistant professor in the field of computational cardiology at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. I obtained my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. You can find the most updated list of publications in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9wRFbcEAAAAJ&hl=en). And you can learn more about my research [here](https://fsahli.github.io/research/).

One of my hobbies is to build speakers. You can read more about that in this [blog](https://fsahli.wordpress.com/blog/), plus some other unrelated things.

Here is a recent talk I gave in the "Modeling the cardiac function" 2021 conference, about physics-informed neural networks applied to cardiac electrophysiology:
