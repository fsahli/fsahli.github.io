I am an assistant professor in the field of computational cardiology at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. I obtained my PhD degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. You can find the most updated list of publications in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9wRFbcEAAAAJ&hl=en). You can learn more about my research [here](https://fsahli.github.io/research/) and watching some of my [talks]((https://fsahli.github.io/talks/)

Check out one our latest projects about physics-informed neural networks: [Fibernet](https://fsahli.github.io/research/fibernet)

One of my hobbies is to build speakers. You can read more about that in this [blog](https://fsahli.wordpress.com/blog/), plus some other unrelated things.
