We are actively seeking master and Ph.D students with backgrounds in engineering, mathematics or related fields, with interest in the intersection of machine learning and computational modeling. 

Students can apply to the [Engineering Sciences program](https://www.ing.uc.cl/en/programas-de-estudio/postgrado/doctorado-ciencias-la-ingenieria/) and the graduate programs of the [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/es/programas-de-estudio/postgrado)

There are multiple opportunities for funding, including internal fellowships and through [ANID](https://www.anid.cl/capital-humano/doctorado-nacional/).

If interested, send me a e-mail at fsc at ing.puc.cl
